NXP SiMKit (loader release 5.3, device release 5.3)

Warning detected by hpeesofsim during netlist flattening.
    In `X1.HS6_1finger2', parameter Mc=1 is outside legal range 'from [0:0.99] clip warn'.
Warning detected by hpeesofsim in LinearCollapse '_2_' during analysis.
    LinearCollapse is disabled because there is 'DC' analysis present.

Model bjt504t, SiMKit release 5.3, Copyright NXP Semiconductors 2000 - 2020.
Warning detected by hpeesofsim in topology check during circuit set up.
    Number of nodes with only one device attached (topology corrected): 1
    Number of nodes with no DC path to ground (topology corrected): 1


SP SP1[1] <MyLibrary1_lib:cell_2:schematic>   freq=(100 MHz->10 GHz)
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    The simulation temperature (25.0 C) is not the same as the IEEE standard
    noise temperature (290 K or 16.85 C) in the noise analysis `SP1'.
    If the simulation temperature is not equal to the IEEE standard temperature,
    then the loss and the noise figure will not agree for a passive circuit.
    The `Temp' parameter on the Options item can be set to 16.85 C to
    eliminate this warning message.



DC DC1[1] <MyLibrary1_lib:cell_2:schematic>  
.
DC convergence achieved in 64 iterations.

Resource usage:
  Total stopwatch time     =     1.07 seconds.
