NXP SiMKit (loader release 5.3, device release 5.3)

Warning detected by hpeesofsim during netlist flattening.
    In `X1.HS6_1finger2', parameter Mc=1 is outside legal range 'from [0:0.99] clip warn'.
Warning detected by hpeesofsim in LinearCollapse '_61_' during analysis.
    LinearCollapse is disabled because there is 'DC' analysis present.
